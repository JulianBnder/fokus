To make working with the application more attractive, define your own currencies. For example make “*Super Points*” harder to earn, but offer better rewards.

*Points* are the basic currency of the app. You can define up to 3 new currencies. You will be able to use them when creating tasks and rewards. Default and custom points do not connect.

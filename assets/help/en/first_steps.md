Fokus is a mobile application that helps kids complete their daily tasks under parental control. There are 2 modes:  

**Caregiver Mode**:  
You need to create a caregiver account to use the app. Caregivers can create and assign children profiles for kids they will work with.

**Child Mode**:  
This mode is designed for a child who performs tasks created by the caregiver.

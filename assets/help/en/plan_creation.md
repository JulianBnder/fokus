A plan is a collection of thematically related tasks. Each plan has a name, repeatability and a task list. Repeatability determines how often the plan occurs for children. 

- *A recurring plan* is a weekly or monthly repetition of the plan.
- *One-time plan* occurs only once.
- *Until completed* option repeats the plan each day until it is completed.

Additionally, the recurring plan can be limited by a date range. This way you can create a plan that, for example, repeats every Monday and Friday of the next month.

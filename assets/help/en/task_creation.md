Task is a basic assignment for the child to complete. It contains fields for the name, description, awarded points, and time to complete the task. In addition, you can add individual steps to a task, called subtasks, to help children complete them. Tasks can be mandatory or optional.

- Mandatory tasks must be performed in order.
- Optional tasks can be performed out of sequence.
